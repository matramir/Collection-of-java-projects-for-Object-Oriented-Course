The main objective of this lab exercise was to generate an instance of an external class that would store an array of candidates with their amount of votes, calculate the percentage of votes and display the winner candidate.
It used the javax.swing and java.text libraries to request and display the information.
The project contains two classes: (1) Vote, and (2) VoteDemo.
The folder contains the project files and a .JAR executable file.
